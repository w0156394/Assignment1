Description:
Biology 11 is intended to give students an understanding of the many different forms of living things and how living things came to be. The class is a “survey course,” covering the fundamentals yet providing students with important problem-solving skills and more awareness of the many misconceptions about biology. The course covers the five Kingdoms of living things including
-   Kingdom Monera (e.g. the flesh-eating disease bacteria Necrotizing fasciitis),
-   Kingdom Protista (e.g. the malaria-causing protozoan Plasmodium vivax),
-   Kingdom Fungi (e.g. Athletes foot),
-   Kingdom Plantae (e.g. almost everything green!), and
-   Kingdom Animalia (e.g. you and your dog and your dog’s fleas!).
