Room 312

Description:
Law 12 fosters skills and attitudes that enhance students' abilities to address legal, social, and ethical issues, and reflect critically on the role of law in society. The study of law also promotes the skills and abilities needed to clearly express ideas, argue effectively and logically, and accurately interpret the written word. To meet career challenges, students need to make decisions, think critically, solve problems, work both independently and with others, and recognize their legal rights and responsibilities. This course consists of four modules: Foundations of Law, Criminal Law, Civil Law, and Law and the Family. There is a consumable workbook (or activities that can be completed online) and a test for each module, as well as a final exam.
