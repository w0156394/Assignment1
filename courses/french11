Description:

Intermediate French is a communicative, intensive, accelerated course that builds on the vocabulary and structures learned in Basic French. Under the theme of "Reaching Out," students acquire more communication skills in the context of hosting French-speaking visitors, visiting a missions project in Paris, and exploring cultures and organizations around the world. Each module includes multi-level interactive activities, web links and webquests, and culture notes.
