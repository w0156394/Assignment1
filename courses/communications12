Room 202

Description:
* Communications 12 allows a student to graduate from high school, but it does not qualify that student to
advance to post secondary education without upgrading. 

This course continues the emphasis on literacy and on practical skills for the work place begun in Communications 11. This course focusses on the essential language skills students need to function in daily life, the workplace, and effective communication with others. The Communications 11 and 12 curriculum is designed for students who do not plan to pursue academic studies beyond Grade 12.
